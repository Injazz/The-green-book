# Comments

You can write your own comments in the source code file, by using `//<line that needs to be ignored by compiler>` for one-line comments, and `/* <lines that needs to be ignored by compiler> */` for multi-line comments
```
//Compiler will ignore this line, so you can write whatever you want
//But better write some short description what you did in the code

/*
Compiler will ignore all lines inside,
So you can write whatever you want
Although I suggest you to use it to write the descriptions for your own code
*/
```

I suggest you to read all comment blocks provided further in this book's code snippets, because they're gonna tell you a lot about what the code actually does.
